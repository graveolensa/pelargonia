pelargonia is going to be a "complex analysis observatory"

okay, let's define what a complex analysis observatory should be:

it should allow one to domain color arbitrary functions of the
complex plane in real time. it should allow one to save the
functions that one has already created, and should optimize
the internal representations of those functions in real time
so that the mathematician using it has to think very little
about the number crunching going on the background. 

more later. need to sleep now.
